My Logger is an app designed for quick and easy logging of any events in your life in an organized way. When was the last time x happened? 🤔 How often does it occur? How many times did it happen over the past month?

In this app, you can track anything, but to help you decide what to focus on, I suggest the following four categories:

1. Things you want to do more often,
2. Things you want to do less frequently,
3. Things you’re simply curious about, in terms of how often they happen,
4. Things that happen in a certain context and you’d like to record.

Collecting such information will not only satisfy your curiosity but also:

- Help you quickly recall when and what occurred.
- Assist you in setting specific (because they are numeric), measurable (because you have a logger), and realistic (because you know your current status) goals and resolutions.
- Aid you in making everyday decisions, as you’ll have useful information at your fingertips.
- Increase your awareness of how your life looks in the areas you monitor, leading to a range of further benefits!

This app could change your life.

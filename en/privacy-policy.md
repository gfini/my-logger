## My Logger App Privacy Policy

*Effective as of 23.05.2025. Changes history is available [here](https://github.com/gfini/my-logger/commits/main/en/privacy-policy.md).*

My Logger is a free application. It is provided at no cost and is intended for use as-is.

All data entered into the app is stored exclusively on the user's device. The app creator does not collect, process, or store any user data. No data is processed or transmitted outside the EU.

The app does not contain any advertisements or tracking code. User behavior within the app is neither monitored nor recorded by the developer or any third parties.

The app connects to the internet solely to fetch data shared by the developer via a [public repository on GitHub](https://github.com/gfini/my-logger). This includes, for example, information about the availability of new versions of the app.

The data controller (if any data were to be collected) is ABC, located at Poet√≥w 10A/7, 03-147 Warszawa, NIP: 524-297-12-82, REGON: 525246306. If you have any questions, please contact the developer at mylogger@gfini.com.

This privacy policy may be updated. Any changes will be published on this page. Users are encouraged to check this page regularly to stay informed about any updates. In the event of significant changes to the policy, users will be notified directly within the app.

User privacy is our priority. That is why the app is designed to minimize any collection of user data.

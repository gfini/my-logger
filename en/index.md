        <h3>What is this app?</h3>
        <p>My Logger is an Android app that lets you easily log and track any events from your life in an organized way. When was the last time <i>x</i> happened? 🤔 How often does it happen? How many times did it happen in the past month? Is it happening more and more often, or less and less? Below, I provide examples and explain how powerful 💪 answers to such questions can be!</p>

        <h3>What to log?</h3>
        <p>You can track any events with this app, so to help you decide, I suggest the following 4 categories:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Things you want to do more often
                <ul>
                    <li>physical activity (walking, specific sports 🏐🏊‍♂️⛳...)</li>
                    <li>other healthy habits (stretching, cold showers, meditation 🧘‍♀️...)</li>
                    <li>meeting with friends or family ❤️</li>
                    <li>reading a book 📖 with some coffee ☕</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Things you want to do less often
                <ul>
                    <li>harmful habits (alcohol 🍷, smoking...)</li>
                    <li>emotional outbursts (nail biting, yelling at someone 🙊, worrying...)</li>
                    <li>getting lost in social media scrolling 📱</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Things you're simply curious about how often they happen
                <ul>
                    <li>replacing things: dish sponge, toothbrush, batteries 🔋, vacuum cleaner bag...</li>
                    <li>something annoying that keeps happening at work :P</li>
                    <li>going to the cinema 🍿 or theatre</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Things that happen in a specific context and you want to preserve them
                <ul>
                    <li>quick journal (e.g., vacation memories 🏝️, special events...)</li>
                    <li>milestones (e.g., in a project, goal achievement 🎯, new habits...)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Your only limits are your imagination ✨ and curiosity 🧐😊.</p>

### Benefits of logging
Collecting this kind of information will not only satisfy your curiosity but also:
- Help you quickly recall when and what happened.
- Help you set specific (because numeric), measurable (because you have a logger), and realistic (because you know where you stand) goals and resolutions.
- Help you make everyday decisions (because now you know whether the more expensive sponge is worth it 😜).
- Increase your awareness of what your life really looks like in the areas you monitor. That brings a range of further benefits:
    - Greater sense of control over your life. This gives you satisfaction, peace of mind, more confidence, and motivation to change for the better 🙂.
    - Better understanding of yourself and your surroundings, which leads to many emotional and practical benefits.
    - Identification of areas worth improving (related to health, relationships, finances, work, personal time — whatever you choose to log 😉).
    - Recognition of resources you're using differently than you’d like (time, energy, money).

### Try the beta version!
You're one of the lucky people who found this page very early! 🎉 The app is currently in development and not publicly available on the Play Store. But you can still get it! If you want to receive the benefits described above **completely for free**, fill out <a href="https://forms.gle/2hEkZGoRS87F9Q7T6" target="_blank">this form</a>, and I'll give you access to the beta version and send you an email with a link to the app 😊📲.

### Data and privacy
Currently, all the data you enter into the app is stored on your phone. I have no access to this data and do not collect any of your information without your consent. You can check the [privacy policy](privacy-policy).

If you want to protect your data in case you lose your phone, you can enable automatic backups in the app settings or manually export your data to a CSV file. You can then import it into the app on a new device.

### System requirements
The app is targeting Android 14 currently (Android 15 will be supported soon), but it remains compatible down to Android 8.0 Oreo. So if your phone is less than 8 years old, it should work just fine 🙂.

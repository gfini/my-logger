        <h3>What is this app?</h3>
        <p>My Logger is an Android app that lets you quickly and conveniently record (log) and track events from your life in an organized way. When was the last time <i>x</i> happened? 🤔 How often does it occur? How many times did it happen in the past month? Is it happening more often, or less often? Or maybe it’s about time it happened again? With My Logger, you’ll always have the answers at hand! 💪</p>

### Data and privacy
Currently, all data you enter into the app is stored on your phone. I do not have access to this data and I do not collect any of your information without your consent. You can check the [privacy policy](privacy-policy) here.

If you want to secure your data in case of phone loss, in the settings you can enable automatic backup or manually export your data to a CSV file. You can then import it into the app on a new device.

### System requirements
The app runs on all versions of Android from 8.0 Oreo and up. So if your phone is less than 8 years old, it should work just fine 🙂.

# What’s new in version 1.8

*release date in Play Store: not yet (even for closed testers)*

<div style="height: 10px;" class="mobile-hidden"></div>

    <div class="app-screenshot-description">
        <h3>Minute-level precision 🕥</h3>
        <p>From now on, loggers can record the exact time — including minutes! By default, everything works the old way, but if you need more precision, just toggle the switch and you’re done.</p>
        <p>The exact time is selected using the standard Android time picker, but for convenience I’ve also added +/-5 min buttons.</p>
        <p>What else changes for precise loggers? See for yourself! 😊</p>

        <h3>New look of the logging screen 📝</h3>
        <p>The time elapsed since a given log has been moved from the dialog title to a dedicated section above the date picker. This makes it cleaner and more readable, and you can now see this information also when logging directly from the home screen.</p>
        <p>In place of the title, I added an automatically generated “log name” that tells you which log number it is within the current month.</p>

### A few other small fixes
- **UI improvement** 📲: The displayed time elapsed since a given log is now updated in real time (to the minute).
- **bugfix** 🪲: Another fix to the link-detection regex — it now correctly matches subdomains consisting only of digits, e.g. 3.basecamp.com.

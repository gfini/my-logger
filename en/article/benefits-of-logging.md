# Benefits of logging
Collecting this kind of information will not only satisfy your curiosity but also:
- Help you quickly recall when and what happened.
- Help you set specific (because numeric), measurable (because you have a logger), and realistic (because you know where you stand) goals and resolutions.
- Help you make everyday decisions (because now you know whether the more expensive sponge is worth it 😜).
- Increase your awareness of what your life really looks like in the areas you monitor. That brings a range of further benefits:
    - Greater sense of control over your life. This gives you satisfaction, peace of mind, more confidence, and motivation to change for the better 🙂.
    - Better understanding of yourself and your surroundings, which leads to many emotional and practical benefits.
    - Identification of areas worth improving (related to health, relationships, finances, work, personal time — whatever you choose to log 😉).
    - Recognition of resources you're using differently than you’d like (time, energy, money).
